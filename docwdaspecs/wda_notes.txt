Final row =
*********, <observation count>

Where there are multiple sets of dimensions one set must come first

e.g.

4,x=5,y=6
7,x=12,y=25
0,x=6,z=0
12,x=9,z=99

note all x/y before any x/z

Likewise if some obs are counts, and some are percentages

Likewise keep together obs with the same number of dimensions


We only care about:

1 obs
2 datamarking  -- if obs isn't a number, make it a datamarking
? geography -- if not E-code, stick it in anyway.
18 time value -- will recieve a msg
19 copy 18
21 time type -- eg "year"
36+8n dim name -- eg "gender"
37+8n copy 36
39+8n dim value -- eg "male"
40+8n copy 40
